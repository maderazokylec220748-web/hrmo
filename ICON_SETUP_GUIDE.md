# How to Set the Municipality Logo as Your App Icon

To use the Bayan ng San Jose, Batangas logo as your desktop icon:

## Quick Steps:

1. **Save the logo image:**
   - Save the municipality logo as: `san_jose_logo.png`
   - Place it in: `c:\Users\TECH4ED DTC 2\Desktop\system mu\public\`

2. **Convert to ICO format:**
   - Windows shortcuts need `.ico` format (not PNG)
   - Use an online converter: https://convertio.co/png-ico/

If you prefer to do it manually:

1. Right-click the desktop shortcut → Properties
2. Click "Change Icon" button
3. Click "Browse"

**Note:** I've created a placeholder for the icon. To use your actual logo, follow the steps above to convert the image to .ico format and place it in the public folder.
